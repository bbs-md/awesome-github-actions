# Awesome GitHub Actions

 - A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.

- Workflows are defined in the .github/workflows directory in a repository, and a repository can have multiple workflows, each of which can perform a different set of tasks.

- This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of GitHub Actions workflows examples. It provides a variety of workflow configurations that demonstrate different use cases and best practices for automating CI/CD processes using GitHub Actions. Explore the provided examples to streamline your development workflows, improve code quality, automate tests, and enhance the overall efficiency of your software delivery pipeline.
